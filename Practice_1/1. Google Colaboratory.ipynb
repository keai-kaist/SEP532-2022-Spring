    "\n",
    "- Colaboratory is a **free Jupyter notebook environment** that requires no setup and runs entirely in the cloud.\n",
    "- With Colaboratory you can write and execute code, save and share your analyses, and access powerful computing resources, all for free from your browser.\n",
    "- Colaboratory is run on a Ubuntu 18.04 virtual machine equipped with 13GB RAM, ~310GB Storage limits, and GPUs (K80, TPU).\n",
    "- You can use the computing services for a maximum of 12 hours at a time\n",
    "    - Basically, you are connected to a virtual machine that lives for a maximum of 12 hours at a time.\n",
    "    - All data including model parameters that aren’t saved to the Google Drive before this period will be lost\n",
    "    - After 12 hours, you will be assigned to a different virtual machine and this cycle repeats\n"
