These vectors are trainable. After training (on enough data), words with similar meanings often have similar vectors. This index-lookup is much more efficient than the equivalent operation of passing a one-hot encoded vector through a `tf.keras.layers.Dense` layer.\n",

The `tf.keras.layers.Bidirectional` wrapper can also be used with an RNN layer. This propagates the input forward and backwards through the RNN layer and then concatenates the final output. \n",

    "    - The main disadvantage of a bidirectional RNN is that you can't efficiently stream predictions as words are being added to the end.\n",
