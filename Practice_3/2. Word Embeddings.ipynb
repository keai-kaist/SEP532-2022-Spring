    "Machine learning models take vectors (arrays of numbers) as input. When working with text, the first thing you must do is come up with a strategy to convert strings to numbers (or to \"vectorize\" the text) before feeding it to the model. In this section, you will look at three strategies for doing so."

    "#### Representing text as numbers: One-hot encodings \n",
    "First method for representing the text as numbers is an \"one-hot\" encode each word in the vocabulary. Consider the sentence \"The cat sat on the mat\". The vocabulary (or unique words) in this sentence is (cat, mat, on, sat, the). To represent each word, we will create a zero vector with length equal to the vocabulary, then place a one in the index that corresponds to the word. This approach is shown in the following diagram.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Diagram of one-hot encodings](images/one-hot.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a vector that contains the encoding of the sentence, we could then concatenate the one-hot vectors for each word.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key point:** This approach is **inefficient**. A one-hot encoded vector is **sparse (meaning, most indicices are zero)**. Imagine we have 10,000 words in the vocabulary. To one-hot encode each word, we would create a vector where 99.99% of the elements are zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Encode each word with a unique number\n",
    "There is another apporach of one-hot encoding. This is to encode each word using a unique number. Continuing the example above, we could assign 1 to \"cat\", 2 to \"mat\", and so on. We could then **encode the sentence \"The cat sat on the mat\" as a dense vector like [5, 1, 4, 3, 5, 2]**. This appoach is efficient. Instead of a sparse vector, we now have a dense one (where all elements are full).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two downsides to this approach:\n",
    "- The integer-encoding is arbitrary (**it does not capture any relationship between words**).\n",
    "- An integer-encoding can be challenging for a model to interpret. A linear classifier, for example, learns a single weight for each feature. Because there is no relationship between the similarity of any two words and the similarity of their encodings, this feature-weight combination is not meaningful.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Word embeddings\n",
    "Word embeddings give us a way to use an **efficient, dense representation in which similar words have a similar encoding**. Importantly, we do not have to specify this encoding by hand. An embedding is a dense vector of floating point values (the length of the vector is a parameter you specify).\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of specifying the values for the embedding manually, they are **trainable parameters** (weights learned by the model during training, in the same way a model learns weights for a dense layer). It is common to see word embeddings that are 8-dimensional (for small datasets), up to 1024-dimensions when working with large datasets. **A higher dimensional embedding can capture fine-grained relationships between words, but takes more data to learn.**\n",
    "\n",
    "![Diagram of an embedding](images/embeddings.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Above is a diagram for a word embedding. Each word is represented as a 4-dimensional vector of floating point values. Another way to think of an embedding is as \"lookup table\". After these weights have been learned, we can encode each word by looking up the dense vector it corresponds to in the table.\n",
